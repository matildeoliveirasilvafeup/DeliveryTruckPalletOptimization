## Project Description

This project focuses on the **Delivery Truck Pallet Packing Optimization Problem**, a real-world variation of the 0/1 Knapsack Problem (0/1 KP). The objective is to optimize the packing of pallets into a delivery truck to maximize profit while respecting the truck's maximum weight capacity. 

Key goals include:

- Developing teamwork skills by working in groups of 2-3 students.
- Implementing multiple algorithmic approaches to solve the problem: exhaustive search, dynamic programming, greedy/approximation algorithms, and linear integer programming.
- Evaluating performance and accuracy across datasets.
- Delivering a concise demo presentation showcasing algorithmic solutions, trade-offs between optimality and efficiency, and challenges faced.

## Problem Motivation

Efficiently packing delivery trucks is critical in logistics and supply chain management. Companies aim to maximize shipment value while adhering to weight restrictions. 

- **Truck** → Knapsack  
- **Pallets** → Items with specific weight and profit  
- **Objective** → Select a subset of pallets to maximize total profit without exceeding truck capacity  

This project explores algorithmic trade-offs between **optimality, efficiency, and feasibility** in real-world optimization.
